## 📖 About

**Rensa** is a platform dedicated to the art of authentic photography. In a world of heavy post-processing and filters, Rensa focuses on the magic that happens *inside* the camera.

The application allows photographers to share and discover **"Camera Recipes"**—the specific combination of film simulations, white balance shifts, dynamic range settings, and tone curves used to capture a distinct look. Whether you are shooting with Fujifilm, Ricoh, or other custom-profile capable cameras, Rensa helps you document and share the exact settings that created your image.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🎞️ Recipe Sharing**: Upload your photos alongside the detailed camera settings (Film Simulation, ISO, Grain Effect, WB Shift, etc.) used to create them.
- **🔍 EXIF Integration**: Automatically extracts metadata to help populate recipe details (if implemented).
- **🎨 Visual Library**: Browse a gallery of distinct visual styles (Vintage, Cinematic, B&W) and apply the settings to your own camera.
- **📱 Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a beautiful viewing experience on any device.
- **⚡ Modern Performance**: Powered by Next.js and TypeScript for fast loading and seamless navigation.
